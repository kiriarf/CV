## About Me

My name is Kiril Drobysevskij and I a recent Makers Academy graduate. Prior to joining Makers, I had been working as an analytics consultant for a year, where I gained extensive experience in data engineering and visualisation, as well as teamwork and project management best practices, such as Agile. In 2019, I graduated from UCL Economics and Business with First Class Honours.

As I have progressed through my academic studies and, subsequently, my career, I have identified my superficial understanding of programming to be a barrier for my future growth, therefore, I have joined Makers to build a strong foundation of programming knowledge and switch my career path to software development. I plan to use this knowledge in conjunction with the data engineering and visualisation expertise I gained through my career to enhance my understanding of end-to-end software architecture and to become an efficient developer.

## Skills

#### Ability to Learn Quickly

Due to the lack of a technical background, I have encountered a steep learning curve in the early
months of my time as a consultant, yet, with each new project and each new tool that I picked up, I
have seen my expertise and understanding of data solutions grow. Starting with developing
unsophisticated reports in Power BI and Tableau, I have gained foundational knowledge of relational
data models and the best practices of data visualisation, which has helped me to move onto complex
data engineering and cloud architecture projects within several months.

Although economics is a vastly different discipline to programming, self-study and research skills that I gained with my degree are highly transferable and will aid
me in overcoming any learning challenge, which is called for by the nature of work as a software engineer, where one has to develop continuously and stay up-to-date with the industry.

## Hobbies

My main hobby is playing What? Where? When? and other similar games. It is a Russian game, where a team of six players needs to answer a question within a minute. The closest analogy would be a pub quiz, but questions are not trivia, and are answered with logic and deduction.

Furthermore, I always seek to try new experiences, such as skydiving, surfing and wakeboarding. During lockdown, I found a passion in cooking and trying to recreate my favourite dishes from scratch. I also enjoy playing video games (CS:GO, LoL, Dota, Overwatch) with my friends

In the past year, we got a puppy and a kitten and my life has been revolving around them ever since :)
