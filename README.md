## About Me

My name is Kiril Drobysevskij and I am an aspiring software engineer, currently enrolled at Makers Academy. Prior to joining Makers, I have been working as an analytics consultant for a year, where I gained extensive experience in data engineering and visualisation, as well as teamwork and project management best practices, such as Agile. In 2019, I have graduated from UCL Economics and Business with First Class Honours.

As I have progressed through my academic studies and, subsequently, my career, I have come to a
realisation that my superficial understanding of programming has been a limiting factor to
implementing solutions with a desired level of functionality. I joined Makers to build a strong foundation of programming knowledge and switch my career path to software development. I plan to use this knowledge in conjunction with the data engineering and visualisation expertise I gained through my career to enhance my understanding of end-to-end software architecture and become an efficient developer.
